# Forge app environment variables (example)
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# As of now, the Forge app does not require any runtime env vars.
# - We searched the codebase for both `process.env.*` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`
#   and found no app-specific variables being read at runtime.
# - `apps/forge/next.config.js` references `process.env.NODE_ENV`, which is
#   provided automatically by Next.js during build/dev.
#
# If/when you add variables, prefer the following conventions:
# - Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_...` for variables that must be exposed to the browser.
# - Use unprefixed names for server-only usage (e.g., API keys). Do NOT
#   leak secrets to the client by prefixing them with NEXT_PUBLIC_.
#
# Example placeholders (commented out, not currently used):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=
# NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=development
# BACKEND_SERVICE_URL=
# SENTRY_DSN=
